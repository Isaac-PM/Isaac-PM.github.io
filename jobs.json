        "description": "Currently investigating the track resolution discrepancies between HLT1 and HLT2, the two stages of LHCb's High-Level Trigger (HLT) system, specifically at the RICH1 subdetector. This study compares HLT1, which performs partial reconstruction on GPUs, with HLT2, exploring the potential for incorporating RICH1 information into HLT1. These insights may inform future improvements in HLT1â€™s reconstruction capabilities, potentially enhancing the accuracy and efficiency of early-stage data filtering and event selection.",

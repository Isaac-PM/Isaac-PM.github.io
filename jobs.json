    "description": "Analyzed LHCb open data to study CP violation in B meson decays. Conducted data pre-processing, invariant mass reconstruction, and Dalitz plot analyzes to explore global and local matter-antimatter asymmetries. Utilized Python and Jupyter notebooks for data manipulation, fitting models, and statistical analysis to evaluate CP asymmetry with high precision. Results underscored the utility of LHCb open data in fundamental physics research.",

    "institution": "European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN)",
    "location": "Costa Rica & Switzerland",
    "description": "Currently investigating the track resolution discrepancies between HLT1 and HLT2, the two stages of LHCb's High-Level Trigger (HLT) system, specifically at the RICH1 subdetector. This study compares HLT1, which performs partial reconstruction on GPUs, with HLT2, exploring the potential for incorporating RICH1 information into HLT1. These insights may inform future improvements in HLT1â€™s reconstruction capabilities, potentially enhancing the accuracy and efficiency of early-stage data filtering and event selection.",
